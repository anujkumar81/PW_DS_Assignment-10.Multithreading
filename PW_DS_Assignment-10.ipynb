    "'''State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading'''\n",

    "#Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "'''1. Concurrent Execution: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same process. This can lead to better resource utilization and improved overall performance.\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading can help keep user interfaces responsive. In applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), threads can handle background tasks without freezing the user interface.\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory space, making it easier to share data and communicate between threads. This is particularly useful for communication and coordination between different parts of an application.\n",
    "4. Efficient I/O Operations: Threads are well-suited for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network operations, file I/O) because they can continue executing while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "5. Task Organization: Threads are a natural way to structure an application with multiple tasks or components that can run independently. They can help in designing modular and maintainable code.'''\n",
    "# Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "'''1. Complexity: Multithreaded programming is inherently more complex than single-threaded programming. Managing thread synchronization, avoiding race conditions, and debugging can be challenging.\n",
    "2. Race Conditions: Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, leading to unpredictable and incorrect behavior. Proper synchronization mechanisms are required to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "3. Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a standstill. Avoiding and recovering from deadlocks can be difficult.\n",
    "4. Overhead: Threads come with overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage. Each thread has its own stack and resources associated with it. Creating and managing threads can lead to overhead, especially for lightweight tasks.\n",
    "5. Limited Parallelism: In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the true parallelism of threads for CPU-bound tasks. This means that even though you have multiple threads, they might not run on multiple cores simultaneously.'''\n"

    "Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource. This can happen when two threads are each holding a resource that the other thread needs. For example, two threads might be each holding a lock on a different file. If each thread is waiting for the other thread to release its lock, then the two threads will be deadlocked.\n",

This can happen when two threads are both trying to modify the same data at the same time. For example, two threads might be both trying to increment the same counter. If the two threads do not synchronize their access to the counter, then the final value of the counter may be incorrect.\n",

There are a number of techniques that can be used to prevent deadlocks and race conditions, such as using locks, semaphores, and mutexes to synchronize access to shared resources.'''\n",
